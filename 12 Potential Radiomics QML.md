[Advanced Discussion: Potential Radiomics Quantum ML Workflows](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/advanced-discussion-potential-quantum-radiomics-ml-workflows) PDF + Discussion 9/21/23.

Here, potential quantum radiomics applications are presented. Classical innovations for Steps 1)-4) have several reconstruction and segmentation algorithm FDA approvals (Slide 4). Radiomics primarily focuses on dimensionality reduction through advanced feature extraction and feature selection, along with other methods depicted in Steps 5)-8) (Slide 4). 

Quantum computing or quantum machine learning working models may see implementation regarding future Steps 1)-8) (Slides 5-9). Presentation was performed [live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFjoUWVDWTo).
