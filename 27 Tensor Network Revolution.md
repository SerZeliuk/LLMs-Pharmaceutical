[Tensor Network Developer Revolution: 125 Lines of Code or Directions](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/tensor-network-developer-revolution) Event Seminar and PDF 03/07/24.

Artificial intelligence pace of innovation will continue to increase at a high rate which will require higher levels of model transparency, explainability, and controllability for sensitive data analysis. In 2024 literature, a more explainable and controllable tensor network used quantum-inspired model correlation space instead of traditional and less explainable methods to reduce a Large Language Model size.

Also this year, a hybrid tensor network and neural network improved performance over running respective network separately. In addition, two tensor networks invalidated prior compute advancements used in other technologies. Here, three seminars were reviewed to aid towards the progress of the tensor network developer revolution - aimed towards increasing transparency in today's AI models. Further developments were made to a TensorNetwork library classification model, and additional coding insights were provided.

Transparency: refers to the degree to which the inner workings of a model or system are accessible and understandable. Transparent systems provide visibility into their processes, data, and algorithms, allowing users to scrutinize and verify their operations. Transparency is closely related to interpretability and explainability but encompasses broader aspects of openness and accessibility.

Explainability: goes a step further than interpretable models. It not only allows humans to understand its decisions but also provides explanations or justifications for those decisions in a clear and understandable manner. These explanations help users understand why a particular decision was made.

Controllability: refers to the ability to influence or manipulate the behavior of a system or model. A controllable model not only provides insights into its operations but also allows users to actively steer its decisions or outputs based on their preferences or requirements.
