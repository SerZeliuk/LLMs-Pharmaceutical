[Optimizing Quantum Parameters for Better Results](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/optimizing-quantum-parameters-for-better-results) PDF + Discussion 4/6/23.

The IBM Qiskit "Quantum Convolution Neural Network" model was revised to achieve 100% Training and 100% Testing accuracies. This was achieved by applying what was learned from Preliminary Modifications (Slide 23, attached), coupled with a modification to a Key Quantum algorithm. (1, 2)

In addition, Xanadu Pennylane's “Quanvolutional Neural Networks” model was revised to achieve significant improvements in output channel image quality, higher accuracy, and lower loss. This was achieved by applying what was learned from Preliminary Modifications (Slide 24), coupled with modifications to 3 Quantum hyperparameters. (3, 4)

Professional networking post impressions were over 70,000 in the last 7 days, primarily due to these two sets of results. Existing quantum computing advantages are already available for the importing of Neuroimages, video. (5) Optimizing quantum parameters for better results is also a focal point, video. (6) 

ChemicalQDevice strives to achieve Good Machine Learning Practices (GMLP) for future quantum hybrid performance models focusing on neuroimage analysis. Best regards.
