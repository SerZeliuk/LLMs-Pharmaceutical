► "They used Grover's algorithm to conduct searches inside their pose determination system and proved higher performance compared to a classical approach. Also, they mentioned another advantage of the quantum system regarding the required memory to store the required vertices for image processing since it needed 3.1 GBytes of classical memory compared to only 35 quantum bits."

► "A quantum circuit was designed using basic quantum logic gates, and the preparation process of INCQI quantum images on the IBMQ quantum computer was elaborated to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm. The experiments show that the quantum image control circuit designed based on the INCQI can successfully prepare quantum image system, which verifies the feasibility of INCQI quantum image preparation process."
