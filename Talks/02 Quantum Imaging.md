Dear Colleague, 

Next Discussion: "Quantum imaging making personalized medicine a reality" Thursday 9/8 6:00 PM PDT Episode 47 (Live/Virtual). Nature Portfolio ad feature being reviewed: [A](https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-018-00265-z)

Article Key Points: 
► "One team is seeking to improve the sensitivity of MRI technology by combining hyperpolarization with nitrogen-vacancy centers [quantum sensors]"
► “Aneurysms, arteriosclerosis and myocardial ischemia can be targeted using nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems with MRI "
► “We’re also working on new medical therapies that allow treatment while monitoring, by combining MRI and nanoparticle technologies”
