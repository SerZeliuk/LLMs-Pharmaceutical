[Multimodal Neuroimaging, and QML for Alzheimerâ€™s](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/multimodal-neuroimaging-and-qml-for-alzheimers) PDF + Discussion 1/12/23.

Dear Healthcare Colleague,

The History of Medical Imaging and AI in Healthcare was detailed this week. Both radiation and sound based treatments were unique inventions before being experimented on patients. Today, Imaging is relied upon - from guiding time sensitive surgeries, to pediatric use with the doctor bedside.

IBM Watson achieved Backward reasoning in 2011, and was used for identification of neurodegenerative related proteins in 2017. In the Late 1990s/early 2000s healthcare research utilizing Deep Learning greatly improved services available to hospitals today. 

In recent years, academic papers and industry partners have used quantum computing and quanvolutional neural networks for preliminary Medical Image classification. Currently, ChemicalQDevice anticipates availability of NSF's practical quantum computer, and IBM's 16,000 qubit modular system this year - to aid Alzheimer's algorithm development.
