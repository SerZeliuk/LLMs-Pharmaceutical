[QML, and Neuroimaging AI ML Alzheimer's Prediction](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/qml-and-neuroimaging-ai-ml-alzheimers-prediction) PDF + Discussion 12/22/22.

Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare is assisting users of electronic devices to collect useful information about their health in more convenient ways. Large corporations manufacturing wearables have made progress in integrating Hospitals, Research Organizations, and Insurance Agencies policy with patient data securely in real time.

According to Deloitte, 83% of US physicians expect that patient-generated data integrated with care delivery will be standard in 2-7 years. (1) For instance, Apple iPhone and Watch covers 17 areas of health and fitness, and enables a Central and secure place to store and view health data. (2, 3) 

Given the success in enabling users to collect their own Healthcare Data and share with Doctors, demand is expected to continue by utilizing quantum sensing and computing in coming years, pending miniaturization. Progress made by companies such as Apple with Parkinson's monitoring, may continue with new uses in Hospital and/or Mobile applications utilizing quantum entanglement and superpositioning.
 
Have a healthy and productive 2023! 

“We‘ve gone as far as we can with traditional research. Now we have technology in our pockets that lets us go even further.” - Dr. Helen Link Egger of Duke University Medical Center
