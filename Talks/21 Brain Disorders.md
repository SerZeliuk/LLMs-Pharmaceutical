[Brain Disorders and Quantum Computing](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/brain-disorders-and-quantum-computing) PDF + Discussion 3/2/23.

In a 2023 review of deep learning models with Brain MRI, researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital, Columbia University N.Y., and Massachusetts General Hospital helped explain the rise of artificial intelligence in peer-reviewed publications. Quantum computing allows for additional potential regarding preliminary studies due to its improving capability to process larger data sets/models. (1-2)

In addition, fields such as automated machine learning (AutoML) are desired to achieve levels of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to that of neural networks and logistic regression. Benefits from hybrid quantum computing may be realized due to their ability to process specific tasks quicker than with conventional methods, especially as hardware becomes more practical. (3-4) 

Quantum programming options has seen growth over the past few years. AWS Braket's service now rents out 5 different quantum hardware manufacturers across 4 different hardware technologies, which includes a supported development platform. (5)

Alternatively, users can download Anaconda, a Python programming language distribution, which contains Jupyter Notebook to assist in developing quantum circuits for healthcare, then run on a quantum computer of their choice. Here, CEO Kevin Kawchak will investigate Neuroradiology literature, and detail how quantum coding can aid in prospective software as a medical device effectiveness. (6-8)
