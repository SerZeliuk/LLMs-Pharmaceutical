Dear Colleague, 

Next Discussion: “Organoid Imaging Technology Improvements” Thursday 9/15 6:00 PM PDT Episode 48 (Live/Virtual). Literature being reviewed: [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8945799/)

Organoid Imaging limitations:
► Light Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) generates huge terabytes of data during recording and measurement"
► Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) uses a very small laser beam resulting in a long acquisition time.
► Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) both have "low temporal resolution, which means image acquisition takes a long time."

NEW Quantum Imaging: 
► "Quantum imaging is a new sub-field of quantum optics that exploits quantum correlations such as quantum entanglement of the electromagnetic field in order to image objects with a resolution or other imaging criteria that is beyond what is possible in classical optics." [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_imaging)
► "Examples of quantum imaging are quantum ghost imaging, quantum lithography, sub-shot-noise imaging, and quantum sensing." [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_imaging)
► "New techniques emerged, such as ghost imaging of objects - in which the quantum correlations between photons reveal the image from photons that have never interacted with the object." Nature 2019: [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0056-0)
► "Quantum approaches in imaging can also lead to an improvement in the performance of conventional imaging systems." Nature 2019: [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-019-0056-0)
► "Quantum mechanically entangled light particles break down the boundaries of conventional optics and allow a glimpse into previously invisible wavelength ranges, thus bringing about new possibilities for imaging techniques, microscopy and spectroscopy."
