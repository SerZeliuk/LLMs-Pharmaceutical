Next Discussion: “Brain Organoids and Quantum Technologies” Thursday 9/1 6:00 PM PDT (Live/Virtual) Episode 46. The Increase of Brain Organoid research provides opportunities for medical instrumentation to further incorporate emerging quantum technologies. 

Future of Organoids:
► "Technological advances in the coming years will resolve the vascular and structural support difficulties researchers currently experience to allow the growth of larger, highly reproducible organoids."
► "In combination with live-cell imaging, brain organoids will vastly accelerate progress in understanding the complex signaling patterns that drive cell fate, neuronal migration, and neurite extension." 
► "Organoids will afford researchers a system for studying characteristics of the nervous system that are uniquely human."

Future of Organoids and Medical Instrumentation:
► "Advances in microscopy will become broadly accessible and afford researchers the ability to visualize subcellular machinery with unprecedented resolution."
► "Higher-resolution imaging of the human brain will allow deciphering new understanding of circuit functionalities paving the way for neural modulatory interventions."
► "Statistical and computational methods, such as machine learning, will become essential."
