[QML Product Development for Neuroimaging & Dementia](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/qml-product-development-for-neuroimaging-alzheimers) PDF + Discussion 12/1/22.

AI/ML Medical Imaging is becoming faster and more automated with recent announcements made by Google Cloud, Amazon, and Nuance Communications/NVIDIA. 

ChemicalQDevice Stage I is Quantum Machine Learning (QML) incorporation into existing Neuroimages for prospective advancements in Alzheimer's Disease Prediction that is software based.

A summary of two previously published articles that lay a framework for Stage I objectives are included in the attached Slide Deck (Slides 9-13).

Stage II is Growth Potential by creating better Neuroimages using QML as an improvement over existing ML platforms in Image Formation and Image Computing that is software/hardware based (Slide 49). 

A quantum circuit successfully run on IBM Qiskit is highlighted. Business objectives including Revenue Generation, Product-Market Fit, and Healthcare/Quantum Cause and Effect troubleshooting are also detailed. Discussion: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSzzaIsyCAg&t=240s)
