[Trapped Ion Quantum Computers for Neuroradiology](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/trapped-ion-quantum-computers-for-neuroradiology) PDF + Discussion 2/16/23.

Trapped Ion quantum computers have emerged as a leading hardware candidate due to their quantum bit coherence, all to all qubit connectivity, and prospective advantages in medical radiology. (1-3)

The American Physical Society (APS) March 2023 meeting features several organizations utilizing the technology:
(4) IonQ, M64.00003 : Machine Learning for Image Classification on a Trapped Ion Quantum Computer
(5) Duke University, B67.00001 : Next generation universal trapped-ion quantum computing system
(6) Quantinuum, Y69.00005 : Experimental Quantum Error Correction on Quantinuum Ion Trap

Here, CEO Kevin Kawchak will provide analysis of three papers influential toward Ion Trap being utilized for Neuroradiology:
"Strategies for practical advantage of fault-tolerant circuit design in noisy trapped-ion quantum computers" Heuben, S., et al., arXiv. 2023. [A](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10017.pdf)
"Robustness and Explainability of Image Classification Based on QCNN" Chen, G., et al. Quantum Engineering. 2023. [B](https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/que/2023/2842217.pdf)
"A Fully Connected Quantum Convolutional Neural Network for Classifying Ischemic Cardiopathy" Ullah, U., et al., IEEE Access. 2022. [C](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9999181)

AWS: The hardware technology "uses perfect atomic qubits drawn from nature, suspended in a vacuum and connected by lasers, eliminating the need to manufacture or fine-tune the qubits synthetically." (7)
