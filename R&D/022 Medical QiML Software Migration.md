A) Tensor Networks reduce complexity by decomposing a large tensor into a network of smaller tensors of smaller rank <br>
a) For single many qubit circuits limited by RAM, TNs simulate many-body quantum wavefunctions efficiently <br>
b) TNs have access to a Hilbert space that grows exponentially with the number of qubits <br>
c) Tensor networks perform better when the network mimics the local structure of the data, in general <br>
d) Tensor Networks take exact quantum states, and produce solutions in an efficient manner <br>
