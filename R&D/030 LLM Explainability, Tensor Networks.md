[LLM Explainability or Controllability Improvements with Tensor Networks](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/llm-explainability-with-tensor-networks) Event Seminar and PDF 03/28/24.

Customers will always want a newer product than what is currently on the market. As higher performing Large Language Models is a priority today, greater Explainability and Controllability will likely be the next key benefit available through quantum-inspired Tensor Networks. In addition, future products will also need to utilize high-dimensional datasets with greater problem complexity while reducing model size effectively - which have been identified in tensor network implementations.

Attached are several Tensor Network studies that are progressing machine learning and LLMs from high performing tools to more interpretable and manageable software for prospective use in hospitals by Doctors who need to verify AI results.  The event seminar is also available on the company channel.
