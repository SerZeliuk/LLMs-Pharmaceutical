[100 Resources for Medical QML Software Developers](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/100-resources-for-medical-qml-software-developers) PDF 9/9/23.

100 Resources for Medical QML Software Developers are attached in recognition of the upcoming 100th consecutive weekly discussion regarding Quantum Technologies beginning in October 2021.

Worth noting: Certain medical diseases are mentioned, but QML will likely apply to many areas related to health. For Startup research: The goal of developing a model that contains both quantum and classical trainable networks for many medical images is still being pursued.

Future studies in Industry will likely feature improved understanding of quantum physics with larger datasets. In addition, better utilization of quantum computing parameters will likely increase the benefits of trainable quantum algorithms in hybrid models.

The performance gains between different types of quantum algorithms in hybrid models was witnessed across studies, but Quantum Machine Learning will likely need to improve over the current Parameterized Quantum Circuit method for benefit over classical models.
