[FDA AI ML Medical Device Guidelines; Potential QML](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/fda-aiml-medical-device-guidelines-potential-qml) PDF + Discussion 10/19/23.

The FDA has made significant progress regarding the approval of advanced AI/ML Enabled Medical Devices in recent years. Instead of devices being 'locked' to retraining after approval, the Total Product Life Cycle now allows for the addition of different inputs, as well as addressing bias while the device is being used in Hospitals. Here, three recent FDA whitepapers are reviewed, along with three expert speaker summaries that are based on FDA's emerging technology guidelines. On October 19, 2023 the FDA added 171 approved AI/ML [Devices](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-aiml-enabled-medical-devices). 

New Quantum inspired Machine Learning (QiML) workflows can be thought of in similar ways to today's Machine Learning in that some bits are used for the notebook and classical deep learning, while other bits are now for simulating qubits (Slide 13). Since these qubits are free of quantum noise and are compatible with existing ML processes, additional developments of high performance quantum simulator specific algorithms should be a priority. Additional CPU RAM or GPU RAM will permit more quantum parameters for potentially better performance and new utilities in Medical.
