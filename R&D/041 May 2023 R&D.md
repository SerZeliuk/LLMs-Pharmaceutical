➤ Original MVP: Brain Tumor Dataset, Binary Classification, Quantum
Transfer Learning for High Validation Accuracy and Low Loss <br>
➤ Iteration #1: Increased Dataset Size, Optimized Hyperparameters for
Improved Validation Loss = 0.069 and Accuracy = 0.990. <br>
➤ Iteration #2: Glioma/Meningioma/Pituitary/Notumor 1572 Multiclass
Images, Hyperparameter Optimizations, Scalable Model by Classes. <br>
➤ Iteration #3: Quantum Circuit and Embedding Methods Screened for
Best Runtimes, Train/Validation Losses and Accuracies. <br>
➤ Iteration #4: Circuit 5 from Iteration #3 Utilized for Improved Quantum
Multiclass Validation Accuracy = 0.875 vs Classical Model. <br>
