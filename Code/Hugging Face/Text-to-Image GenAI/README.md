Introduction: Text-to-Image generative artificial intelligence has accelerated "practical and creative applications" in many fields of research. [01] Most notably, readily available access to open-source software by PyTorch and Hugging Face performed on powerful GPUs has allowed for rapid advancements in image quality output using only a few words. Here, a leading Runway AI computer vision model called runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 was utilized to produce photo-realistic images in healthcare from simple text prompts. [02]

A StableDiffusionPipeline model was created through the aid of a Hugging Face tutorial with ChatGPT 3.5 and HuggingChat assistance. [03-05] After loading, each query generated high quality images of human interactions in hospital settings within 2 seconds using a single NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU. Triplicates of the following three different text prompts for a total of (9) 512x512 color images are available for download. [A2] The sampled outputs from "doctor helping another patient", "nurses utilizing medical ai at the hospital", and "hospital staff using generative ai in safe and effective ways" require further analysis to determine that they were created with computer software based on prior training images.

Future company work in Medical Generative AI will likely focus on 1) The efficient re-training of open-source pre-trained models using techniques such as LoRA, 2) Incorporations of tensor networks layer by layer into new or existing models, and 3) Creating near-term solutions for customer problems in ways that provide increased probable benefit over probable risk.
