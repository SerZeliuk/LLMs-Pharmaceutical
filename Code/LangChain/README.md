## OpenAI's New GPT-4o Large Language Model on a NVIDIA L4 24GB GPU 
Performed very well when compared to an Anthropic LLM, and A100 40GB workflows. In specific, using LangChain's Code Assistant: gpt-4o and nvidia L4 was used for higher output accuracy, but had some errors. A LangChain Agent Supervisor model with gpt-4o was most concise and less expensive vs. gpt-3.5-turbo. The RAPTOR LangChain model was 10x Faster vs. mentioned ways above, with gpt-4o having more relevant answers vs. gpt-3.5-turbo.
