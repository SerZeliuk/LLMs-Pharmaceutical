Quantum-inspired machine learning 2.0 has removed the need for AI developments using quantum computers, although applications in other fields may exist. Researchers have accomplished this by utilizing dequantized algorithms to remove quantum speed-ups, performance tensor networks for high dimensional problems, and circuit partitioning for noise-free and larger qubit simulations once thought to be unattainable. 

01) Many key algorithms have been dequantized, removing quantum exponential speed advantage
02) Tensor networks proven to be more accurate, faster, or precise than quantum computers
03) Sensitive data analysis is not viable due to abundant quantum noise
04) Error correction and postselection up to 850,000x slower than circuit execution
05) Decoherence between qubits is still too high for many applications
06) Latency of quantum computer and communications are significantly slow
07) Extensive quantum computer cooling is energy inefficient 
08) Many shots, or evaluations, are required to obtain an acceptable answer
09) Quantum data cannot be copied; requiring a high reliance on cpus for operation
10) Quantum sensors currently donâ€™t output quantum data needed for advantage
11) Poor differentiation methods vs. efficient traditional backpropagation
12) No effective continuously updating quantum machine learning algorithms 
13) Dynamic circuit techniques added for performance, but rely on cpu processing
14) Postselection process to condition outputs is also performed by cpu processing
15) Quantum hardware cost of running competitive experiments is high
16) Quantum hardware availability to researchers across the world is low
17) Slow pace of innovation and notably poorer results vs. quantum-inspired in recent years
18) Faulty quantum computers would be delayed in utilizing upcoming AI-assisted code platforms

In summary, quantum-inspired machine learning 2.0 software features safe and effective processing based on quantum mechanics that are optimized for today's machine learning applications. (19-20)
