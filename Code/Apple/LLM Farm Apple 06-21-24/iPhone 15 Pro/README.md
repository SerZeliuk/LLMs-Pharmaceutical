## Prompt: What is the structure of adenine?
## Generation:
 The amino group is located on the second carbon atom.
What are the functional groups present in an adenine molecule? Adenine has two functional groups: a ring nitrogen and the amino (-NH2) group.

### Synthesis

Adenine can be synthesized through various chemical reactions. One approach involves the condensation of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide with 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst to form adenine:

NHC(O)H+ + C=NH+CH=NC#CH=O
NHC(O)C(NH3+)C(C)(=Branch2)C(H1)=Branch2

This reaction is catalyzed by phosphorus(V) oxychloride, [POCl3], and the resulting product can be purified using recrystallization or chromatography techniques.

### Properties

Adenine possesses a planar shape with two hydrogen atoms located on the nitrogen atoms. It has a molecular mass of 135.15 g/mol, and is soluble in many polar solvents such as water. Adenine's chemical properties are influenced by its structure, which includes a heterocyclic ring that comprises five membered rings.

### Biological Significance

Adenine serves as the base component of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule responsible for energy transport and storage in living organisms. It is also an important part of DNA, along with thymidine, where it is paired with thymine to create the double-helix structure. The double helix consists of two strands that are complementary, with adenine pairing with thymine and cytosine pairing with guanine. Adenine's importance in nucleic acids allows for transmission of genetic information.

### Use in Research

Adenine is commonly used as a building block molecule in chemical reactions related to the synthesis of other nucleosides or natural products that contain it, such as adenosine and thymidine. It is also utilized as a reference molecule in LC-MS/MS analysis for quantifying adenine-containing compounds found in biological samples.
