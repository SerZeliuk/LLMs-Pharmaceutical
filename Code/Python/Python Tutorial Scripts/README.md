Python is a main language for the creation and execution of many Generative AI programs. Methods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Multimodal Models, RAPTOR, Agents, and Finetuning utilize the readable and versatile Python platform. Key industry players such as OpenAI, LangChain, and Hugging Face all heavily utilize Python for product deployments. (01-04)

Here, 34 Python scripts based on the ‘Python Intermediate Tutorial’ by NeuralNine were keyed in manually and are available on the open-source GitHub repository. In specific: Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Sockets and Networks, and Recursion were just some of the 11 primary areas covered. The majority of the supplementary files are also included for learning purposes, with the exception of the data.xml file. (05)
