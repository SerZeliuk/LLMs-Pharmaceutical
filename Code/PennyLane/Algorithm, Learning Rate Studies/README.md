The following are modifications or improvements to original notebooks. Please refer to the authors' models for the published primary work. Algorithm HRyERyT1 had the lowest test loss and high test accuracy of 96.7%. HRyERyT6 and Author's Algorithm had higher test loss, but with the high test accuracy. HRyERyT8 and HRyE had higher loss, with an accuracy of 96.1%. The author's original model accuracy was 85.0%. Based on the 'Quantum Transfer Learning' [PennyLane model](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_transfer_learning). The 2 Class PyTorch Hymenoptera Dataset downloads using this [Link](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/hymenoptera_data.zip). A classical transfer learning [model](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html) at 3/25 epochs achieved 90.2% Accuracy for the 'fine tuning' setting, and 94.8% for the 'feature extractor' setting.
