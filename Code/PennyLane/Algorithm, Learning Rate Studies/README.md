The following are modifications or improvements to original notebooks. Please refer to the authors' models for the published primary work. 
Based on the 'Quantum Transfer Learning' [PennyLane model](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_transfer_learning). The 2 Class PyTorch Hymenoptera Dataset downloads using this [Link](https://download.pytorch.org/tutorial/hymenoptera_data.zip). A classical transfer learning [model](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html) at 3/25 epochs achieved 90.2% Accuracy for the 'fine tuning' setting, and 94.8% for the 'feature extractor' setting.
