Based on the 'Quantum Transfer Learning' [PennyLane model](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_transfer_learning) or 'Transfer Learning for Computer Vision Tutorial' [Stanford model](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html). The quantum machine learning method adds a quantum circuit to the TLFE method, in general. 2/4 Class Brain Tumor Dataset is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset), Smaller 10 Class from 44 Classes Brain Tumor Dataset is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernando2rad/brain-tumor-mri-images-44c?select=Germinoma+T2), Larger 10 Class from 17 Classes Brain Tumor Dataset is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernando2rad/brain-tumor-mri-images-17-classes).
