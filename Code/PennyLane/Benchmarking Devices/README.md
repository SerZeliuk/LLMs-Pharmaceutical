The following are modifications or improvements to original notebooks. Please refer to the authors' models for the published primary work.
Notebooks results added to the [Benchmarking Quantum Machine Learning Devices PDF](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/benchmarking-quantum-machine-learning-devices), Based on the 'An equivariant graph embedding' [PennyLane Model](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_equivariant_graph_embedding). Later Run on 10/2/23: A100 Lightning.gpu runs averaged 20.04 seconds which was approximately 1.2x or 5 seconds faster than V100 Lightning.gpu.
