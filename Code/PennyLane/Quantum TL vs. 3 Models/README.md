The following are modifications or improvements to original notebooks. Please refer to the authors' models for the published primary work. Notebooks results added to [44 Class Classification Quantum TL vs. TL Transformer vs. 2 Classical TL](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/44-class-classification-quantum-tl-vs-tl-transformer-vs-2-classical-tl), 
and [Specific QiML Algorithms for Medical R&D Applications](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/specific-qiml-algorithms-for-medical-rd-applications).<br>
The ViT model was assisted by OpenAI. The confusion matrix results showed an extra row and column of data. <br>
Based on the 'Quantum Transfer Learning' [PennyLane model](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quantum_transfer_learning). 44 Class Dataset is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fernando2rad/brain-tumor-mri-images-44c?select=Germinoma+T2).
