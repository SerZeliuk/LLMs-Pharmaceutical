C++ programming language plays a significant role in improving the speed and control of today's Generative AI applications. Here, 43 C++ source files covering key principles of the language are available open source on GitHub, and were manually typed from freeCodeCamp/giraffeacademy's 4 Hr 2018 ‘C++ Tutorial for Beginners - Full Course’. (01-03) 

In specific: topics such pointers, constructors, and getters/setters were extended manually for illustration purposes, including 43_C++_Inheritkkawchak.cpp using AI and Generative AI context through inheritance. C++ will be utilized with other technologies developed in this open source repository to create new drug discovery applications. ChatGPT 4o assisted in the summarization of source code and corresponding output shown on the second slide. (04) #summerofcode
