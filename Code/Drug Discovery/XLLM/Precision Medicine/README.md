### Can LLMs Help Researchers Automate Individual Disease Drug Design?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are improving existing drug discovery AI tasks with advanced functionalities to facilitate molecular simulation and reaction prediction. As a central point, LLMs can interact with public databases, and also use reinforcement learning combined with smaller models and high throughput screening platforms to advance drugs for individual diseases. The future of precision medicine looks to further implement LLMs to improve potential compounds for screening in later drug discovery stages.

Several Extra Large Language Models (XLLMs) were tested for speed and generation quality analysis using ten different medicinal chemistry prompts, shown on slide 08. Key findings are further summarized in the July 17, 2024 [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jAfDg9pQ_O1N5GKcGxtgv409mf8xDhF8/view). Have a terrific rest of your week.
