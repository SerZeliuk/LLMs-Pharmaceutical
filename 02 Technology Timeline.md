[Quantum Technology Timeline](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/quantum-timeline-6-30-22) PDF + Discussion 6/29/22.

History leading up to prospective Neuroscience/quantum applications.

Dear Colleague,

A Quantum Timeline is attached to help understand the Technologyâ€™s future in #Healthcare and #Neuroscience. U.S. Government Initiatives have had a Significant Impact on Quantum Innovation. Those familiar with the technology may be surprised how much progress has been made since the National Science Foundation (NSF) started funding these projects in the 1980s; which now forecasts a practical quantum computer in 2023.

Sincerely, <br>
Founder CEO <br>
