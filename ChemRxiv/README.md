&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many machine learning models used in academia and industry that identify organic compounds typically lack the ability to converse over prompts and results, and also require expertise across a number of steps to obtain answers. The purpose of this study was primarily to gain insight into the advantages of current unmodified state of the art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across several prompts containing multiple spectra of varying difficulty to evaluate the impact of training data, reasoning, and speed. These readily available and easy to use software for the identification of an organic compound based on a molecular formula and spectra were found to be reproducible across three similar LMMs. To the author's best knowledge, this marks the first time that three GPT variants were each able to correctly identify the organic compound quinoline using a variety of different spectroscopic images. The results were obtained using a 2-step process consisting of a) Uploading high resolution spectral images, and b) Submitting a text prompt with the images that requested a compound determination. The main findings were that 1) Four LMMs provided rationale step-by-step interpretations of 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and 3 DEPT-NMR spectra from Prompt A, 2) Three of these LMMs, led by a GPT-5 preview model, combined these interpretations into the correct chemical structure with Prompt A, and 3) Two of these LMMs achieved a top score of 5/5 for also generating sequential explanations reflecting the order of the provided spectra along with most of the correct spectral and molecular formula explanations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemical research is more effectively progressed using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) combined with Document Retrieval and recently published literature. The methods described here illustrate significant strides over previously tested Large Language Model (LLM) multi-document workflows for characterization assistance and generating new reactions. Here, 3.5 Sonnet, ScholarGPT, and ChatGPT 4o LMMs processed either 5 images or 5 supplementary documents from leading 2024 journals. Each of the three models performed inference on a detailed prompt to produce a response that included context from attachments. In addition, the LMMs were not provided with which of the 5 files contained the answer. The main findings were that 3.5 Sonnet had an average score of 9.8 for images, while two judges awarded high scores to ChatGPT 4o (9.7, 9.4) and ScholarGPT (9.5, 9.4) for document analysis. Judging was performed by a human evaluator for the image uploads, with document processing evaluated by Llama 3.1 405B and Nemotron 4 340B LLMs which correlated well and improved explainability. Highlights include 3.5 Sonnet's ability to interpret a Two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (2D NMR) spectrum accurately, along with Judge Llama 3.1's ability to provide consistent formatted scores with explanations. The results shown here help illustrate AI's continued revitalization of the established chemical research field.
