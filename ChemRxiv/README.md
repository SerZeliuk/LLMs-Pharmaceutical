&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemical research is more effectively progressed using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) combined with Document Retrieval and recently published literature. The methods described here illustrate significant strides over previously tested Large Language Model (LLM) multi-document workflows for characterization assistance and generating new reactions. Here, 3.5 Sonnet, ScholarGPT, and ChatGPT 4o LMMs processed either 5 images or 5 supplementary documents from leading 2024 journals. Each of the three models performed inference on a detailed prompt to produce a response that included context from attachments. In addition, the LMMs were not provided with which of the 5 files contained the answer. The main findings were that 3.5 Sonnet had an average score of 9.8 for images, while two judges awarded high scores to ChatGPT 4o (9.7, 9.4) and ScholarGPT (9.5, 9.4) for document analysis. Judging was performed by a human evaluator for the image uploads, with document processing evaluated by Llama 3.1 405B and Nemotron 4 340B LLMs which correlated well and improved explainability. Highlights include 3.5 Sonnet's ability to interpret a Two-dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (2D NMR) spectrum accurately, along with Judge Llama 3.1's ability to provide consistent formatted scores with explanations. The results shown here help illustrate AI's continued revitalization of the established chemical research field.
