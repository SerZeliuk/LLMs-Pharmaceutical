## Meta Llama 3 Drug Discovery GenAI

[Meta Llama 3 Drug Discovery Generative AI Assistant Development](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/meta-llama-3-drug-discovery-genai) Event Seminar and PDF 05/02/24.

Last week's discussion was viewed by over 7500 people regarding 'Meta Llama 3 Fine tuning, RAG, and Prompt Engineering for Drug Discovery' to learn about the basics of advanced LLMs as they apply to a scientific application. This week, the use of LLM agents to further automate and improve the performance of Generative AI was explored. In specific, an ACS publication used Ontological Knowledge Graphs and multiagent strategies with Llama-2 models to improve materials design. 

An innovative CrowChem AI Agent autonomously planned and executed the syntheses of an insect repellent, three organocatalysts, and guided the discovery of a novel chromophore better than using GPT-4 alone.

“Given a complex task like writing software, a multi-agent approach would break down the task into subtasks to be executed by different roles - such as a software engineer, product manager, designer, QA (quality assurance) engineer, and so on - and have different agents accomplish different subtasks.” - Andrew Ng, Founder of Deeplearning.ai, April 17, 2024.
