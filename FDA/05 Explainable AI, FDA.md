Enhanced Alzheimer's Disease Prediction methods and Better Quality Neuroimages continue to be in demand for both patients and physicians. In 2022, ChemicalQDevice focused on the area of Quantum Machine Learning Neuroimaging (QMLN) to prospectively address these concerns.

Virtual speaking engagements by Mr. Kawchak extended to Washington D.C., London, and Chicago. More recently, Fortune 100 Leaders in Industry have continued to express interest in the Startup.
