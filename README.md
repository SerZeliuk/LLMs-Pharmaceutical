A collection of medical and quantum machine learning algorithm prototypings, parameter studies, and efficiency tests following the build, measure, and learn methodology.

The goal is to implement advanced architecture variational quantum algorithms with more trainable parameters into new models for better performance, which will be developed from state of the art classical deep learning practices.
