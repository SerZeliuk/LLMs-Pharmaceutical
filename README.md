## Medical Quantum Machine Learning
Quantum machine learning is expected to be the primary application of quantum computing. 

The resources in this repository represent a collection of medical and quantum machine learning algorithm prototypings, parameter studies, and efficiency tests using GPUs and CPUs.

The goal is to implement a new variational quantum algorithm architecture with more trainable parameters into existing models for better performance, which will be developed from state of the art classical deep learning techniques.
