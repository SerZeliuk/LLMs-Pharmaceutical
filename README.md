## AI Applications for Drug Industry

 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ChemicalQDevice innovates new LLM/LLM agent pharmaceutical industry applications regarding cancer drug cost containment, clinical decision support, cancer signaling pathways, bioprocess engineering, biosynthesis, characterization, or drug synthesis. OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or xAI direct chat proprietary software are utilized to generate LLM reports and propose detailed solutions. AI governance is employed with relevant software implementations, model bias amplification mitigation, and generation traceability analyses.
