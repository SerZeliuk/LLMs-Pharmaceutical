## Medical Quantum Machine Learning
Quantum machine learning is expected to be the principle application of quantum computing. Exact expectation values, pure quantum states, and efficient differentiation methods allow for quantum algorithm implementations into existing Healthcare ML workflows.

The resources in this repository represent a collection of medical and quantum machine learning algorithm prototypings, parameter studies, and efficiency tests using GPUs and CPUs.

The goal is to implement a new variational quantum algorithm architecture with more trainable parameters into existing models for better performance, analogous to previous classical deep learning advancements.
