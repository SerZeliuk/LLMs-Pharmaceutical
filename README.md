These resources represent a collection of medical and quantum machine learning algorithm prototypings, parameter studies, and efficiency tests using cpus and gpus without quantum computers.

The goal is to implement a new variational quantum algorithm architecture with more trainable parameters into models for better performance, which will be developed from state of the art classical deep learning techniques.
