These resources represent a collection of medical and quantum machine learning algorithm prototypings, parameter studies, and efficiency tests following the build, measure, and learn methodology.

The goal is to implement a new variational quantum algorithm architecture with more trainable parameters into models for better performance, which would be developed from state of the art classical deep learning techniques.
