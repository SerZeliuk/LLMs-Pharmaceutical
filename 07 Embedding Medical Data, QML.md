Two data options exist when utilizing quantum algorithms for potential performance benefits. The first method
is to obtain quantum data through methods such as quantum sensing. This type of data is naturally already
embedded in a “Hilbert space”, but cannot easily be stored yet due to current QRAM limitations, see Figure 1.
Data that can be directly analyzed on a quantum device is desired for performance improvement opportunities
in medical data analysis. <br>

The second method uses readily available classical medical data, and must be correctly mapped using an
embedding layer to a Hilbert space. Several papers and related works have utilized medical images with
quantum algorithms to more closely study binary and multiclass image classifications as shown in Figure 2.
