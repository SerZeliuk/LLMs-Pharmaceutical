[Embedding Medical Data into Quantum Computing Algorithms](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/embedding-medical-data-into-quantum-computing-algorithms) PDF 6/25/23.

When implementing classical Medical Data into hybrid models, the Embedding Layer of the quantum algorithm should be thoroughly tested before scaling up the current project. The three main papers provide several guidelines to reduce barren plateaus as quantum computing continues to improve in understanding and performance.
