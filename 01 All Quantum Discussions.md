Artificial Intelligence innovation is increasing at a high rate. Technologies that are capable to accelerate AI have been depicted through iterations of seminars on the leading quantum computing for medical research discussion. This body of work is supported by the Number 1 public code repository accessible to quantum-inspired healthcare developers. 

In specific, these efforts have enabled reaching a checkpoint to further research tensor networks, dequantized algorithms, or simulated quantum circuits as methods for significantly advancing AI. This field is referred to as quantum-inspired machine learning 2.0, or QiML 2.0, and is compatible with readily available classical hardware.
