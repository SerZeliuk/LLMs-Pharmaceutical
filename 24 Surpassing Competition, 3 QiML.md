[Surpassing the Competition with 3 Quantum-inspired Algorithm Frameworks](https://www.chemicalqdevice.com/surpassing-the-competition-with-3-qiml-frameworks) PDF 02/15/24.

For The Win: 2024 Quantum-inspired Literature has Strengthened the Technology for AI Industry Growth. Quantum-inspired Machine Learning will be the primary quantum computing method to improve artificial intelligence for many years. Performance, Scalable AI solution: QiML rate of adoption and implementation will outpace quantum computers. Quantum computers remain viable for processing quantum data resilient to quantum noise and decoherence. (Slide 20)

Practical, Economical, and Scalable: QiML for higher performance, and sensitive data is safe from quantum noise. Benefit: Dequantized algorithms, Tensor networks, and Quantum algorithm simulation results have become significant, as illustrated by Tang, E., and Huynh, L., Software migration guides, Industry GPU quantum algorithm partnerships. For The Win phrase: describing a play that results in a win, bringing the game to a conclusion. The seminar is available through the startup channel.
